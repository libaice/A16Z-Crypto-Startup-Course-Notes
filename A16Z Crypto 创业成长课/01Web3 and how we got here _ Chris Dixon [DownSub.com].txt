thank you

it's very exciting to have everybody here

um we did this first three years ago

and the original idea was

um was uh that we just felt like in a

lot of meetings we would just sort of

there was just a lot of information that

wasn't kind of getting out to the to the

entrepreneurial Community

um and so we said why don't we kind of

encapsulate all the information and and

do do a a program and frankly it just

really kind of beat our expectations in

terms of the just the excitement level

the

um the great companies that came out of

it

um the number I think we had over a

million views on the videos and so it

was just great and so we said hey why

don't we do it again

um and so that was sort of the origins

of um of the program you're in now and

as Jeff said like we were amazed at kind

of the

number of applications and uh and so

it's just really exciting to do and

we're hoping for another great session

and last time we had um we got hit with

uh kovid and so we didn't get to to do

it all in person so hopefully this time

we'll have a lot of in-person

interactions and a lot of the value will

come from from from

from the folks you meet the other the

other participants and and all the

people on our Network so

great so I'm going to talk a little bit

about

um the uh the the kind of the broad

history of the internet uh why this

whole kind of crypto matters blockchains

matter

um you know what's what's kind of the

big picture in this we're going to have

a lot of follow-up much more detailed

talks uh from from our partners and

friends over the next few weeks so I'll

skip some of the detail here and just

kind of give you the big picture

um so basically what I'm going to talk

about is the way I kind of view the

history of the internet there's three

years three kind of broad histories of

Errors of the internet there was kind of

the pre well the sort of pre-history

which is you know the actual internet

started in the late 60s and they were

sort of government and academic kind of

use cases but kind of really the modern

internet began with the web 1989 and

then you had sort of the internet boom

in the 90s

um obviously you know today it's a sort

of you know throughout permeates all of

our Lives it's a you know it's the the

importance is indisputed but for

actually for a long time during my

career that was actually quite

controversial and there were a lot of

ups and downs along the way but

basically I kind of view and I'll go

into more detail as as breaking down to

three kind of core eras and I believe

we're entering the third era now

um

and then

um and and kind of the way I view it is

um each era is

um has kind of is marked by having a key

Network architecture and I'll talk more

about this but networks are kind of the

in my mind the killer app of the

internet and the architecture there's a

very interesting thing which is the

architecture of how you build those

networks has all sorts of Downstream

consequences in terms of the economics

and the user experience and other kinds

of things so there's kind of this nice

symmetry where there's either way I view

it is this sort of three years the

internet each one had its had its kind

of dominant network type each one also

had kind of it's it's um what I think of

as it's canonical Computing primitive so

the web came along and uh you know you

had this idea imagine you had a product

idea I'm going to have everybody in the

world put information on a big

repository and share it and it's not

going to be total chaos right you need a

simplifying principle right like how are

you going to make this not okay it's a

it's a it's there's it's a the web is

sort of this massive multiplayer social

game right and so like how are you going

to make this thing not cacophonous and

the answer was a website it was a very

it's we take it for granted now it's the

oxygen we breathe we assume this is just

how things are that was a very profound

idea there's some great videos and you

can look at from the 60s of people kind

of inventing these ideas but the idea

was you can take this information

whatever you want to do code data

anything else you want you can put it in

a thing called a website and that

website can link to other websites and

this was a very important kind of

encapsulating mechanism simplifying

mechanism to take this really profound

idea of like all of humanity is going to

have information that links to each

other and make it something that you

could that you could actually kind of

work with right and give it a sort of a

digestible unit

um and then in the right ear so I call

it read write on sort of the read era is

that we democratized in the in the first

year of the internet roughly 1990 to

2005 democratized information

consumption that was mostly what it was

about the killer app of that era

um was Google and Wikipedia and things

like well Wikipedia's a little bit later

but like you Google something and you

find it that was a magical new

experience so someone said that the that

the average user now has more

information at his or her fingertips

than the president United States did 30

years ago right like it's it's kind of

remarkable we obviously I'll take it for

granted that's really what the first era

did but you know having lived through

that I was a software developer back

then it was still very much what I call

skeuomorphic it was the web felt like

you'd take magazines and you'd put them

you know sort of as websites like

brochures and it was it was sort of a

one-way interaction there was some like

you would submit a form or do something

else but it wasn't like a really a

social experience and then um in the uh

I'll just oops

um

in the uh in the kind of 2000s I was

there this is a really exciting time one

of my favorite times in my career was in

the early 2000s and we'd be sitting

around rooms like this literally like

this is kind of like a bunch of people

we were all excited and we're like What

if you could suddenly what if you could

there were little early inklings of it

but like what if you could make the web

really a genuinely two-way medium right

where where it would democratize

publishing the way that the first era

democratized consumption right

um you know so that was there were sort

of early precursors to a lot of it came

out of blogging there was blogging was

kind of this this kind of interesting

Fringe movement where people would post

stuff in simple ways and you had

software to do it

um and that that led to people like Mark

Zuckerberg creating Facebook a lot of

the ideas for social networking and

things were taken from those early kind

of communities of bloggers and other

kinds of things in fact you can kind of

I look at blogging as kind of this

primordial soup where you had all this

kind of genetic mutation and things come

out unless you had Flickr and that

flicker led to photo they were sort of

photo blogging there was link blogging

there was a whole bunch and each one

each kind of genealogy genealogical tree

led to like a whole set of interesting

products

um and so that so that was sort of the

right era um and you know it was a wild

success it was incredible right like it

it like I think back to conversations we

had kind of like this in 20 years ago

and we were like what if someday you

could anyone could publish something

this and then like it's kind of amazing

how well it worked

um but there was um and I'll talk more

about this there was I think there was

sort of this Faustian bargain where

there was a downside to it which is the

the thing that brought us there was a

new network architecture

um called corporate Network I think this

is the next slide yeah so

let me let me then step back for a

second um the the you know one of the

kind of amazing accidents of his

accident historical happen stances I

guess is um I said accident once and I

and Tim berners-lee like said what

accident like you know so anyway so I I

just a blog post so I should be careful

it was a very great design decision

early on and had to do with the history

of the internet it came out of Academia

government IP the actual kind of base

layer of the internet was a DARPA

project

um and uh basically what was at the time

you sort of you're in the 80s and you

want to build this Global multiplayer

social game called the web how do you

architect it there were no Google's AWS

data centers and this and that so you

had to build it in this peer-to-peer way

right and so what they did is they came

up with what we can now call protocols

which are just standards I mean there

you can go and look at the https the

kind of HTTP is this is the standard for

the web and SMTP is a standard for email

and a protocol is kind of like a

language like a language like English

like it's like a set of things like if

you want to send me something here's the

rules for doing it right

um and and the idea was anyone could

just and then what would happen is the

protocol would get built into software

if someone would build open send mail

and Mosaic and all these other kinds of

tools that would that would then take

that and codify that protocol

um and then you go download that

software and you'd be you'd join email

you join the web right

um but very importantly there was no

Central intermediary no one controlled

it there's standard bodies and things

but it's sort of like for we're all

crypto here it's like you know people

debating eips essentially like VIP you

know for like it was sort of a

community-led thing

um there was no no one really in charge

and very importantly it didn't charge

you any money you could put a website

you had to buy a domain eight dollars

but like you put it up and if you build

Amazon literally or Google literally you

made a trillion dollars like and it was

yours right

um or didn't make it the company's worth

that you know so like the point was you

built something and you own it and it's

not just the the big companies this was

a very long tale of creative people you

know artists and game designers and

anyone who wanted to this is a very

important idea anyone who wanted to

could go up as long as it was legal and

you could build a website and if it was

valuable you could keep the money if you

built your musician and the artist or

whatever and you built an audience you

get to keep them same with the email

know this is a very very important idea

and by the way it didn't have to people

kind of look at it like it's inevitable

it's not if you go read the history of

it there were like a lot of smart people

who thought that actually this

information Super Highway if you go read

the history that was not the web that

was this corporate alternative to it run

by Comcast and Disney and other things

in fact it's quick anecdote Bill Gates

wrote a book called the road ahead I

think it was 1995 and it was two years

after the browser came out so kind of

you know things had started

um and he talks about all his

predictions of the future and he did not

use the word the web in that book in

fact later then bought all the copies

and to get them off the market and put

out a revised version and so like it was

not obvious in 19 even 1995 like two

years into like this is two years after

the Netscape IPO you know so this is not

it was it was already happening right

but it was like there were two competing

architectures there's like can companies

own it or is it going to be this crazy

kind of it was a pretty radical idea

like anyone can add something on nobody

owns it

um and and I I would argue it led to all

of these incredible and Innovations in

the 90s right because you had this sense

of genuine ownership you had sort of

property rights um I won't go into the

details but that a very important thing

in that is DNS so DNS is the naming

system of the you know domain name

system so I own C dixon.org and that

maps to an IP address and a very very

important idea in the first year of the

web is that

I I control that mapping it's a very

simple thing right it's just this is

this is a it's a very important point I

think it's lost a lot this one simple

decision which is the user controls the

mapping that shifted all the power of

the network to the user right because

what that means is I can build up my

website I just did this recently I

switched hosting provider for my website

and when I switch host I don't like they

charge me too much they're slow whatever

who cares I have the power I switch

right I switch and I kept my network I

kept my inbound links I kept my search

results same with email although that

you know email you could debate is now

maybe getting kind of hijacked by Gmail

it's so powerful but at least for 25

years email was the same thing you don't

like it you can leave and that what that

did is it forced the providers the Gmail

providers the browsers all these people

to play nice they can't go and they

can't do all these things when we get to

corporate networks we'll talk about

where they play games and take the money

and do all these other things they can't

because you can switch and it's not

switch like fake switch like you know

Facebook has some feature where you can

download a CSV file and take it's that's

it's fake because you don't take your

audience with you if you build up a

million follow I'm I have a lot of

followers on Twitter I can't believe I

can't I can download the follower list

but I can't take my audience with me I

don't want you know I want to opt out I

want to use different software no you

can't do it anyway so

and that that was a very very important

thing and it you know sort of happened

partly through I think the foresight of

the designers

um partly because you just had no other

way to kind of architect it back then

you didn't have Central intermediaries

um you know partly because it was

government funded there's a whole bunch

of reasons but it was a great thing

right

so then

um the uh let me come back to this the

um so then so then in the sort of you

had this rise of the kind of the right

era networks in the 2000s um and you

know this has I guess fast forward for a

second this has led to you know today a

few kind of quick stats

um uh you know so going back is sort of

you had this fascian bargain so you have

these new Services which I'll talk more

about the architecture of them in a

second I call them corporate networks

um they had a lot of advantages things

like YouTube and Twitter and Facebook

they were better user experience you

could subsidize hosting costs you could

do all sorts of things

um and there's a bunch of reasons why

the sort of next year of the internet

was dominated by these corporate

networks the downside I think today you

fast forward and I think it's we're in a

really problematic situation right now

where all these wonderful things I was

talking about earlier in the internet

are basically I mean you still have

those networks but they don't matter as

nearly as much right if you go talk to I

don't know a person down the street in

La who's an influencer they're not

trying to build a website and or an

email list for the most part someone

that there's some backlash with sub

stack and things but for the most part

it's tick tock it's Facebook it's

Instagram Etc right

um and so this has led to the top one

percent of websites is it's 95 of web

traffic 80 I think 85 of mobile apps the

you know the economics are similar the

NASDAQ 150 of NASDAQ 100 is the five big

tech companies that's doubled over the

last decade that will continue to double

things like AI I think will accelerate

those Trends so we're basically like I

don't know if this is you can debate

whether it's a good or bad thing I don't

think it's a good thing but we're

basically headed to a world where five

companies control the internet and it's

very very different than that kind of

original vision

so you know what is the internet like

the internet

we know what the internet is on a

technical level but I I see the internet

as a a system for creating networks so

if you look at your phone

and you think about the things you spend

time on the internet most of what you

interact with are networks

um email is a network uh the web is a

network Tick Tock Network Instagram to

network Uber's Network eBay is a network

like most of the things you do on the

internet networks

um and as I was describing before with

things like DNS

the way you build the network ends up

having all of these very important

Downstream consequences around the

economics and governance and and who who

can build I don't know I would say

a quarter of our companies are rejected

by Apple these days like you want to get

in the app store you got to get the

permission that didn't happen on the web

right the web as long as it was legal

you could do it so who can build you

know there's a very famously uh this

happened with there was a whole period

you're probably all too young remember

this but like a lot of my friends were

building Twitter apps and Facebook apps

2010-ish that was like the thing to do

why because that was sort of the new

internet and you'd build on top of the

new internet and all of those companies

got wiped out because they changed the

apis they changed the rules because they

unilaterally control it

so Network architecture is Destiny and

as I was describing protocol networks

have this sort of decentralized thing

where there's no one in charge corporate

networks you know there's there's a sort

of trade-off that you had which is on

the one hand they can do a lot of stuff

and I'll talk about that there are good

things about it I don't want to

disparage it um too much

um but uh but there's a there's a big

negative which is essentially you're

just saying this company behind it has

complete power they have complete power

of the economics they have complete

power over the governance who has access

all these other things

um and specifically like so for example

there's a very important

um uh and I'll talk more in detail about

it in a bit but there's a very important

Concept in networks called take rate

which is the percentage of the sort of

the money think of it as like there's a

river and there's money flowing through

this River and how much does the does

the network operator take of that River

it's kind of shocking but in social

networks it's basically outside of

YouTube it's 100 all right so they take

100 so it's 150 billion dollars a year

of last year in social networking

Revenue all of it went to the networks

uh you know I think you can make a very

strong case that if it were architected

as a protocol if social networking had

if RSS specifically which I'll talk more

about

had won as an open protocol alternative

social networking a huge part of that

150 billion would have gone to creators

and users and software developers

instead it goes to the central

intermediaries maybe that's a good thing

maybe that's a bad thing but that's the

fact is that the architecture is Destiny

and if you build networks in this way

that are corporate networks

um you end up with the economics and

governance that we have today

um

you know for me the the you know the way

I won't go too much into blockchains

themselves because I know we have

sessions on that I view blockchains as a

they're a new kind of sort of virtual

computer built on a network of computers

the key feature of blockchains is they

invert so in the traditional Computing

architecture

if I you know put put a if Google puts a

server up and puts up a network

um ultimately they control that Network

as they control the hardware they can

change the software they do it all the

time imagine as a thought experiment if

Google said we're going to have Google

coin and we promise we'll only have 21

million Google coins no one would

believe it right because they would just

change it at some point there'd be

different management team or something

else and Founders leave and things

change and you just if you give that

power to one group it's just not it's

not really credible blockchains invert

that what blockchains do is they say

we're handing the power over to software

right

um the software is in charge right if

you write a smart contract in ethereum

this is assuming consensus works and I

think the folks in this room understand

that but like making certain assumptions

and of course in the case of let's say

ethereum these assumptions have held

through the life of ethereum right the

code has if you write code for ethereum

you write something on chain

that that you know that that is

immutable code

and so you can do a lot of things with

immutable code I think the most

important thing you can do with it is

you can build new networks you can build

networks on top of blockchains that

give you the societal benefits of

protocol networks but a lot of the

competitive advantages of corporate

Networks

um I'm gonna I talked about a little bit

about this about protocol networks the

um

the you know I think the key thing to

think about is

that

you kind of divide kind of the features

into two buckets I think of his

economics and control

um so economics very importantly

protocol networks took no money there

was no take rate all the money flowed to

the edges uh on the control as long as

it's legal you can do it you know that

allows for all sorts of interesting

Innovation they had a big weakness which

is how do you fund them right so email

on the web they funded through kind of

government funding and everything else

there's a there's a kind of a really

interesting case study of in the 2000s

there was a protocol for people I know

RSS but RSS was like a legitimate

competitor to Facebook and Twitter I

would say up until I think it's like

2010 or 11 if you look at Google Trends

it dropped dramatically

um and so the idea with RSS is hey like

all these great things we've done with

with the web and

an email and sort of all the advantages

of protocols this new thing social

networking is coming the internet's

going to be more more than just reading

information it's now going to be for

publishing information let's build a

protocol to do that right and so that

was RSS um I was a big RSS user it was

sort of the default early Twitter and

Tumblr and all these Facebook even they

had RSS interoperability that was just

the Assumption you had to have that

um and that was great the problem with

it is you know Facebook is all these

companies they raised many billions of

dollars of venture capital uh they have

they could hire all these developers

very importantly they could subsidize so

let me give you an example so YouTube

came out in 2005 and I remember that it

was like broadband Broadband was just I

think it had just hit like 40 or

something like this a penetration

believe it or not like everyone else saw

a dial up and and so then entrepreneurs

you know being smart entrepreneurs that

they are light bulb went off and they

said hey let's a bunch of friends of

mine and people I knew were you know

were saying hey let now that you've got

Broadband you can have high quality

video so let's go do video startups

right so that was a big wave in like

2005-ish and then just like all these

kind of startup waves you had different

strategies so like some people would go

and try to license content Sports

content and CBS content YouTube actually

YouTube star is a dating site but then

they pivoted a video dating site but

they pivoted and they said let's take

this view of kind of viral social videos

you know anyone can upload anything

right it's very controversial if you go

when Google bought them is very

controversial because they they were

seen as just sort of piracy and it's all

the kind of the sort of stuff you hear

like about crypto today like a lot of

this stuff was very much more Wikipedia

was banned on universities it was huge

controversy but it's crazy now

um but anyway so YouTube said let's you

know let's let anyone do that but the

problem is YouTube had no traffic in the

beginning all right

um and so like why would I go and post

something on YouTube and so they did I

call this strategy I have a blog post

about it come for the tool stay for the

network and the idea is a strategy for

kind of proliferating a network which is

you give sort of you think of a network

there's sort of a single player mode in

the multiplayer mode like a video game

um and so you sort of come up with like

what what's a single player use case

until you have a big enough Network

um and so what YouTube said here's the

single player mode which is you get free

you get free easy hosting so you like I

Chris Dixon have web traffic but it's

all on my website I don't want to care

about YouTube they have no traffic in

the beginning

um and so but but they gave me free

hosting so I went uploaded the video

they hosted it they put in a nice little

um you know widget and then I would

embed it on my site that's actually how

YouTube started right

um but it was free hosting now RSS what

would I have to do at the time I'd have

to go buy a domain which at the 2000s

people like me were still the dominant

internet users like people that had

domains that's not true today most

people don't have domains um it's still

kind of a technical nerdy thing

um you get to go buy domain but then you

had to pay for hosting costs it was

expensive so like host a video and

everything else so YouTube subsidized it

right so that that's a huge

architectural advantage to corporate I

would argue that's probably the main

architectural Advantage corporate

networks had over protocol networks and

why RSS loss to Facebook and Twitter and

everything else is they could raise

venture capital and fund it and by the

way the other thing just mention is

um

if you go back it's funny to think about

but early 2000s eBay was probably the

most uh respected like Wall Street

respected internet company more than

Google more than in fact the stock was

higher than Amazon

um you know Amazon was seen as kind of

this really capex Opex you know heavy

you know they had to actually ship stuff

eBay was this beautiful pure Network

um the uh it was a pure Network effect

they just put up a website you had

sellers you had buyers they didn't have

to ship they didn't have to handle

payments that was outsourced they

eventually bought PayPal but like

um and and it was this beautiful Network

so and and the you know benchmark who

had done there's a book about them like

that was one one probably one of the

most famous I think it was the best

returning one of the best training

Investments of the 90s and so VCS in the

2000s they understood networks right as

being the biggest Money Maker right and

so when YouTube and Twitter you had tons

and tons of money come into that space

and I think it just flooded over and

ended up look if you look at the stats

like it just crushed

um uh you know uh RSS and

um uh and you know and just all sort of

there were a bunch of other attempts to

do kind of protocol Network Alternatives

um so that's why we had sort of this

rise of corporate Network so

um then what happens is this was very

interesting for me is

um

you know I'd say like for me at first I

would say I for me it didn't really the

light bulb didn't go off like this is a

problem until probably 2010-ish or

something

um because at first it's like okay so

what so like you know you've got this

these are subsidizing they're

subsidizing the hosting costs you know

they're still supporting RSS they're

still supporting all these apis this is

a good thing right but then you had this

moment in fact Twitter uh Twitter

launched I believe 2006. they actually

didn't have an app or uh or a client

until 2010 and they they got it through

an acquisition tweety tweety I think or

some other Twitter client

um and then they actually deprecated it

but it was time around like 2011 and 12

if you go look at the news like all

these uh Services basically stop

supporting RSS deprecated all their apis

there's very famously like Zynga and a

bunch of other companies that were like

cut off from Facebook's API Twitter had

this I mean there were there was

literally a VC firm I knew it I knew the

people there who that was focused on

funding Twitter apps it was that big of

a sector I mean there was like it was a

big sector of startups it just like

ended overnight

um and so and at some point it was like

wait what's going on this is different

like this is not like the web so the

web's changing this is for me the light

bulb moment when I got into crypto

um and I you know I've thought about a

lot over the years and this is kind of

my analysis here

um which is what happens is uh you know

you're early on your your Facebook is

basically this cycle and that over time

the incentives this is nothing to do no

one's malicious no bad I'm not impugning

anyone's motives here this is just like

to me the logic of this network which is

these types of networks this

architecture which is when you start off

look you start off your YouTube you're

five people in the room you're doing

everything you can to get creators on

you're giving subsidies you're doing all

sorts you know you're just like because

you have no network effect right

but then eventually you scale up you

have a big Network effect

and your incentives change I mean

literally like I've been in these board

rooms where it's like hey now you got to

focus on making money you know I mean so

there's like the literal kind of

embodiment of it but it's also like at

that point like interoperating isn't as

useful I'm the big guy like if you just

if you kind of look at you know for you

know sort of this Metcalf law which is

this idea that which is roughly accurate

which is the idea that networks kind of

the value increases exponentially as the

number of nodes the network goes up if

you just think about that like if you're

if you're a telecom company that has 95

market share in the country and you're

another Telecom company has five percent

of the you know the 95 person doesn't

really need to interoperate with the

five percent they can have a good

business most people will use a service

five percent needs to right so there's

just a core logic to kind of these

corporate networks where

um the big the bigger you get the less

incentive you have to interoperate uh to

support kind of other networks to allow

creators on and you you get into I say

called the attract extract cycle you

start off trying to attract all these

different people around your network and

then at some point you start squeezing

them

and you try to take the money out

um and to me this comes out of again

it's not like the problem of and people

try to mitigate it you know Google's

famously don't be evil like hey we

promise we're not going to do it but the

reality is Founders leave and you know

and eventually the sort of logic of the

model takes over and like the profit

maximizing strategy of a corporate of a

net of a company that owns a network is

to eventually uh start extracting

um if you don't do it your competitors

will do it and you'll go out of business

so like that's just the way this these

markets work

um so this is the challenge with them

and then I mentioned earlier the take

rates

um you know I think for me the two kind

of there's you people can debate I mean

you see in the headlines there's all

sorts of controversy de-platforming

there's politics there's how do they

rank the algorithms like I'm not gonna

get into that stuff that's not my kind

of main interest my main interest is I'd

say is twofold the economics they take

100 in generally it makes it really

really hard for the ecosystem to make

money and then the stifling Innovation

competition so you know epic is suing is

suing Apple as an example you know maker

fortnite like you know if you've tried

to buy a Kindle I always think it's

funny when you try to buy a Kindle book

on your iPhone you have to go to their

website it's because they're getting

around the payment thing they charge 30

on payments like the the normal fees on

payments is like two percent this is

crazy so

anyways that's corporate networks

um so like I talked a little about this

like look it's you know I the funny

thing about being in the space we're in

is like like I sort of see that the

world is there's people who agree with a

lot of the stuff I've said like Jack

Dorsey and I don't know a bunch of other

kind of people who seem to think okay

there is a problem with corporate

networks I think that's sort of decision

point one a bunch of friends of mine who

are open source developers like decision

point one is do you think there's a

problem today and then this and then

this decision point two is what's the

solution and you'll see a lot of people

try to go back to protocol Networks I I

would love it if we could do that I've

been trying to do it for you know

involved in this stuff for 20 something

years and like literally if you go back

the only protocol networks that ever

gotten to scale were the web and email

and they were both sort of incubated in

this Hatchery fish environment before

they had competition it's been 30 years

since you had a new protocol Network

that's seated and like RSS you know I

have a lot of friends like you see

they'll try to build new things on RSS

like I'd love for succeed but like let's

just be real like it's just not working

and let's go figure out what the problem

is diagnose it and come up with a better

Network architecture

okay

um

there's here's just a slide around the

take rates

um these are the left side is the scale

of these companies the right size the

take rate I'll come later on to

blockchain network take rates you know

zingo was a famous example where they

stifled Innovation so the question is is

there a better way so like you know so

for me like I've been now involved in

this this space for over 10 years

um for me like I started to sort of

sense that there were like real issues

here

um and and you know when blockchains

came along it took me a while to kind of

articulate it the way I am but I think

that to me the exciting part was that

this was a new way that you could build

networks that have the societal benefits

of protocol networks and all the good

things sort of The Best of Both Worlds

the societal benefit protocol networks

but they can actually get funding and

features to compete with

corporate networks

um so uh you know I think folks here

know this and we'll talk more about

blockchains later but you know this

doesn't really come out in the slide but

the essentially a blockchain you still

have a core right you have a blockchain

network so let's take you know something

like uniswap as an example there is core

of smart contract code running right but

the idea is that core two couple things

one is immutable code right so like unit

swap's a good example where

um the the they can't even the even the

community can't change that code right

there's no upgrade mechanism nothing

it's just that code is that code if

they've released new versions it's

literally a new set of code it's

immutable code

it's instead of don't be evil it's can't

be evil they can't change the rules they

can't screw you later on that kind of

attract extract cycle they just can't do

it it's just it's in the code and so you

can decide as a developer as a user you

know or like take a social I think uh

some some folks here building on

forecaster like you have a new Social

Network built on a blockchain right

um they the rules are going to be baked

in there they're in the smart contract

and you can decide if you're a developer

do you want to build on that you can

shop around and you know what you're

getting right that's very important so

you have competition and you have you

know you have people you have Choice

um and so you know what you should think

of here is the core is much much smaller

than in a corporate Network you're

building the way I think about the

analogy I like to think about blockchain

networks is it's much more like building

a city than building like a theme park a

corporate network is like a theme park

in the sense that the corporate owner

you know Facebook they every single

feature of Facebook and Twitter is built

by a Facebook or Twitter or Tick Tock

whatever pick your network it's built by

an employee of that company at this

point essentially right because they've

kind of killed off all the Innovation

around it and so that's why they have

Google has 180 000 employees Facebook

has 50 whatever those people build all

the features right and so if you want to

if you're Twitter and you want to solve

the spam problem they've got to go

figure out how to solve the spam problem

with the email on the web you know the

email spam was a huge issue late 90s

early 2000s what happened what solved it

it's not solved but it's a lot better uh

Market solved it there were 100 you know

two early 2000s there were 50

venture-backed anti-spam companies Gmail

uses postini which they acquired the

startup

so you create use the markets to do it

so blockchains are very similar and that

you have the goal would be like a city

you would sort of like you if you're

building a blockchain network here you

want to go build the core of the network

you know the mayor's the town hall and

the fire department the police sort of

the basic rules and governance really

the minimum you can kind of build and

then you want to create incentives for

people to build around it and those

incentives can be both like they can't

be evil incentive it's like hey if you

build this you get to keep it

um they can also be token incentives and

there's a whole bunch of mechanisms very

rich design space and blockchains to do

all sorts of interesting kind of

incentive design and also by the way to

to accrue capital and fund developers

and all these other things that RSS

couldn't do right this is when I say

it's sort of The Best of Both Worlds

right so you get this open ecosystem

these cities these digital cities it's

kind of substrate upon which you build

the applications and networks of the

future

and and all these kinds of wonderful

things around protocol networks but you

also get funding and then of features it

gets a little more technical here but

like

essentially and I think just speaking

some folks who are doing

um ethereum you know new naming systems

on top of ens East ID the um and and I

think there's a bunch of interesting

ideas there you can also solve a lot of

the issues with um that I was describing

before with things like domain names and

just sort of making it a modern user

experience I mean ideally what we want

right I think in 2023 if you don't have

feature parity with corporate Networks

you're probably not going to make it

like people have very high bar users

have very high bar you need to have a

very good experience you can't charge

eight dollars and buy go buy a domain

name and GoDaddy pay eight dollars and

come back and visit me like it's not

gonna work okay like you gotta have

future parity with corporate networks

you've got to have you know whatever it

is five screen login and all this other

creative account and all these other

kinds of things

um and and having a central logically

centralized organizationally

decentralized blockchain core right so

meaning logically centralized like ens

there's one

place that keeps that database is one

canonical state but it's not controlled

by one person or one organization it's

controlled by a community right that's

that's a that's a brand new thing that

blockchains introduced right so you get

the benefit there's a there's a huge I

could go on about this but if you

compare something like a forecaster to a

mastodon what are called Federated

networks

Federated networks are kind of I think

of them as a subtype of protocol

networks they're still protocol networks

and the basic idea is I will talk about

this it's important I think

um the basic idea with Federated

networks is you're sort of saying this

is Mastodon you folks probably know

about this right so is you're basically

saying I agree with you Chris that

there's a problem with you know one

person owning our Global Micro messaging

services and social networks and all

these other things right some people

don't agree so they agree with that my

solution for solving it is to take this

one big giant dictatorship and chop it

up into a lot of smaller dictatorships

right that's what Federated networks are

so each server is a little mini

dictatorship but the idea is if they get

small enough that people can choose and

play off the little mini dictatorships

against each other and they keeps them

in check and that's the way to keep the

power kind of decentralized right and

that and look I I view that as an

experiment we already ran if Twitter

Tumblr all these services in the 2000s

they were all marketed as RSS servers

and what happens is eventually one of

one or a couple of the sir either it

doesn't work and no one uses the thing

or whatever or it does work and everyone

congregates around a single server

especially in the Federated architecture

because you don't have canonical State

um so so you don't have a central place

to keep a name space and everything else

and so you have all of these like funky

cross server you know um

activity I don't go with all the details

but it's just not going to work in an

elegant way and you're going to have

this you're essentially going to have a

sharded system and then you're going to

have certain if it works certain servers

get powerful and we're just going to run

the same thing we ran before I believe

so I think you need a canonical Central

core to have a

a system with future parity with modern

corporate networks I'm happy I'll take

this uh questions if you guys want to

dig into this more I've this is

something I've thought a lot about but

um I can go long down along Rabbit Hole

so

Elena you picked the best picture of

Disney World to kind of undermines my we

should have picked the worst one but the

idea here was um

she picked such a good picture the point

was of this is that we cities are better

than theme parks although that looks

like a good theme park

um the uh the uh like the idea sort of

the way I view it is like Pro like it's

a really beautiful thing if you think

about the web and email the fact that

particularly the web like the fact that

you just had this one kind of simple

idea and then you have these I think of

it like a city you know you have a city

you know you think about something like

New York

and a great you know great cities right

they're very organic they're very kind

of Bottoms Up

um in the way they develop and they

really and it's a very important feature

is the the interaction between the

private ownership and public ownership

right so if I own a pizza shop

um you know I depend on the fact that

there's free traffic anyone can walk on

the sidewalk right so I depend on the

the and the in the roads and all the

Public Services right and then I pay

taxes back to the public services and

then in turn like what does the private

sector do for the public sector the

private sector at my view adds creative

entrepreneurship right it's just very

hard for Central bodies to think of like

people really want whatever some type of

yoga or pizza shop or whatever it might

be right so in a well-designed city you

get this really nice diversity between

kind of the public thing the parks the

infrastructure that you know that give

people this sort of feeling of an open

shared City but also enable

entrepreneurship but then you also

harness the power of free market

creativity

right

um and I think the web to me the web is

the is the canonical example of that

embodied in a network right there's a

really kind of you have for-profit

things like Google and everything else

and then you have lots of interesting

non-profits Wikipedia is an amazing

thing you know there's just a whole kind

of wide range of it

um and so you had this really nice kind

of interplay and sort of Bottoms Up

organic thing that you kind of see in a

great city as opposed to a carefully

managed curated uh you know kind of

controlled kind of theme park like thing

um

Okay so

so you know let's jump in then to sort

of

um why

um

would one want to you know see a world

with where blockchain networks

proliferate because that's you know that

the The Hope here right is that is it

all of you and other folks working on

this will be at the Forefront of a new

era where we you know this is the new

network architecture that combines the

best of the Both Worlds of the previous

architectures

um the first is community ownership and

this is similar to the kind of protocol

networks where you you have Community

ownership I mean the sense of like we're

all part of the web and everything else

but but it's not like in a strict kind

of economic sense here we add on this is

the read write own kind of this

ownership idea that you can actually own

a piece of the network which is a very

powerful new primitive

um

and that's what a token is I was talking

earlier about how websites encapsulate

you know information consumption this

nice little bundle to me the token is

kind of the key one of the key concepts

of the of this era where

um it encapsulates ownership right so a

token is can be anything it can be

something in the physical world it can

be something in digital world it can be

code it can be a game it can be

art it can be whatever it might be it

could be fungible it could be something

money-like a lot of the public

impression of tokens is around the kind

of money like characteristics that's a

very kind of I think narrow

um uh view of what tokens can be but to

me tokens like a website their way to

take ownership and encapsulate it but

you can put anything in it it's like a

container you can put anything into it

including you know in a good in a

well-designed blockchain network you can

put

things like the ability to vote the

ability to own part of the network to

have a share of the economics that's

what I think something like ether is or

or like uni or something like that the

next major benefit is lower take rates

this is just empirically we have a slide

on this but the take rates of all of the

blockchain networks are vastly lower

than corporate networks is this because

they're all great people no it's because

of the I mean they are all great people

but it's it's uh most mostly great

people or whatever but the um look but

the but the main thing is it's an

architectural thing right like you can't

if you if you charge too much people

will switch the the architecture is

different where you can the switching

costs are much lower you can Fork a

network there's a whole bunch of reasons

why you can't go and charge 90 if you

said I'm going to build you know a

lending protocol and charge 90 like good

luck no one's going to use it right

um and so you know it's the fact that

it's open source it's the fact that the

switching costs are low

that I like to see the network affect a

cruise to the community and not to a

single company there's not one person

you can sort of like go and do all this

kind of stuff uh the ability to Fork

like all these things keep take rates

lower which means like it's sort of a

zero-sum game like that money is going

to flow somewhere

um and so do you want it flowing to the

network operator or do you want it

flowing to the participants in the

network I think it's better for

everybody to have prisons to network and

by the way this is not just like all you

know altruistic this is also a

competitive Advantage you can go to

creators you can go to musicians you can

go to all these people and say hey would

you like to keep zero percent or 95 this

is one of the very powerful things that

I think is going to propel this movement

to success is the fact that the economic

proposition for all these participants

is a much better economic proposition

um incentive to innovate

whatever you build you own

um if you uh um uh you know the rules

are baked into the code like you we're

not going to capriciously whimsically

change them and

um and kill you off and then funding

parity with corporate networks

um

and so I'll go we have a slide on this

but essentially you know the numbers you

see around sort of blockchain networks

and just the amount of funding is is on

par with those you know the example I

like to use is a there's a bug called

the heart bleed bug a few years ago it

was a bug in SSL you know SSL is the

core encryption Pro uh code uh standard

for uh you know all encryption internet

and it came out in that process with

this this was a really dangerous bug

that could have threatened all

encryption on internet it was like half

a developer was working on SSL like it

was no funding that kind of got fixed a

little bit

um you might say well hey look at all

these open source Linux is well funded

it's complicated like Linux if you look

at it the top contributor Linux is Intel

and Intel has a very strategic reason to

support Linux because their main

competitors Windows you know for you

know for the when you sell a PC if you

buy window they make a lot more money on

Linux PC than Windows PC so there's a

whole kind of you have to go analyze all

the political alliances and things

networks have not had natural corporate

allies and so you just did not have

people funding things like RSI because

all the corporate Alternatives were like

I want to own that I don't want to give

fun that that Network

and so networks need their own native

form of funding to have any chance of

success and that's what blockchain's

providing

okay so let me talk a little about

tokens you know uh you see a lot of uh

mainstream discussion of tokens is like

magic money magic beans Warren Buffett

calls it rat poison uh they don't like

tokens I think a lot of them when you

read the analysis I don't know what

they're they're I think they're talking

about Bitcoin or Dogecoin or something I

don't think they've actually

dug into it uh the you know the tokens

uh I see tokens as uh in the tradition

of video games so video games pioneered

uh virtual economy so games like Eve

online the dominant you know League of

Legends fortnite like the dominant

business model video it's very

interesting Side Story I won't go too

long into it but the video game industry

you know 30 years ago made their money

selling uh games for 50 bucks like today

basically all the modern game companies

give the game away for free and make

money in a virtual economy okay this is

not theoretical uh all these critics who

talk about magic beans this is a big

part of the economy that they just

apparently aren't aware of um the um so

so what you want to do in the right kind

of blockchain you know kind of network

design is you want to design a virtual

economy and you have a very simple way I

I this comes from video games they use

these language faucets and sinks

um this is a metaphor imagine of tokens

flowing like

um like water in a in a house or

something and so you have places that

tokens flow out of and things that they

flow into and those are things and so

for example staking rewards are uh one

form of faucet uh air drops other kinds

of incentives and then sinks are things

like on ethereum you pay an access fee

you pay gas fees right and it takes

those and it burns those and that's a

sink and it's something that eats up

tokens it's like a sink it takes them in

right and so what you want to do when

you're designing a blockchain network is

you want to do a couple things but one

is you want to balance the the network

and I believe we're gonna have a few

sessions that are going to much more

detail here so I'm just giving you the

big picture but

um you want to balance it so you don't

have sort of too much Supply or too much

demand and then the the prices go crazy

in one way or the other so you want to

so you want to get a good balance but

the faucets you want to incentivize good

behaviors this is very very powerful and

this just goes back to like how can

blockchain networks win right how can

they fix the the shortcomings of things

like RSS

incentives are a very important thing

here you can use incentives to fund

developers you can use incentives

remember I described the YouTube hosting

example to fund like hosting come for

the tool stay for the network like

blockchain's version of them are faucets

um and then the sink sinks are very

important for like ideally a sink will

align the sink with a useful application

in the network you want to align it with

the Network's utility okay

um so a good sync for like ethereum has

a great sync which says ethereum is a is

a global shared supercomputer in the

cloud that nobody owns and anyone can

access that's what ethereum is it's like

old mainframe computers and that you you

know it's got limited resources it's a

shared resource

um and so the way it solves that is it

charges you to to use the to use the

computer and it charges you in ether and

that's the sink of ether and what's

great about that sync is it should the

demand for ether should go up as people

build more applications for ethereum and

it becomes a more popular Network right

I think a lot of those fees by the way

as an aside will probably be paid for by

the application developers and hidden

from the users in the same way that I

don't pay my AWS fees when I go to Gmail

I think it'll be similar to that but

like the point is like it's tied to the

utility of the economy right so if

somebody creates a game that's a hit

game built on ethereum that will make

demand for ether go up and so it's a

really beautifully nicely designed

economy right it's not magic beans it's

just all economics this is the same

economics that economists have talked

about for hundreds of years for some

reason when it comes to the internet

they don't want to like do the analysis

but this is just economics supply and

demand if you build a network that's

popular and you tie the token of the

network work to the utility of the

network that creates fundamental

sustainable demand not speculative

demand sustainable demand there is

speculation involved in token prices

today as there is speculation involved

in every Tech Market going back to the

railroad boom of the 1830s the.com move

the 90s of course there's speculation if

the point where speculation that would

not be a sustainable thing I wouldn't be

interested in it like the point is to

create fundamental value to create new

networks that have the benefits of

protocol networks better advantage of of

corporate networks and that create new

virtual economies using tokens and

incentives to gain adoption to align in

behaviors and do all these other kinds

of nice things

I talked about take rates these are the

actual take raise Darren here did this

analysis for us

um so like ethereum is a effective take

rate if you go do the math and the gas

0.06 percent just orders of magnitude

different you know if anything like open

C there's pressure to go down on the

take rates so like I think if anything

we're being conservative like I think

there will be downward pressure is my

guess over time on a lot of these take

rates because of the competitive nature

of these markets because so for example

with openseed like they don't own the

nfts they they don't have lock in they

can't force you to stay on there like

these are much more the networks have to

compete right competition lowers prices

take rates or prices of networks it's

the it's the tax you pay

so you know if anything I would think to

go down you know we'll see but

um and then you know I mentioned this

before with the kind of City analogy

um you know one a very important idea in

blockchains is composability

um composability is the idea that you

can this idea that software can be like

Lego bricks that you can build one

person can build a b software and

somebody else can build on top of it

um this is you know like going back to

blockchain social networks personally

I'm

the thing I'm most excited about and

seeing these proliferate is seeing the

composability seeing I'll have like 20

different people will create different

uh client front ends to forecaster and

these other kinds of you know lens and

Etc and there'll be a big diversity

there'll be all this Innovation people

create different ranking algorithms

people will create you know different

analytics tools people will create also

you know some I'm sure all sorts of

crazy stuff this is the to me this is a

really fun part of software is that

it's all of the creativity unlocks

um and then I'm just finding myself

personally like consistently surprised

with how Innovative and creative people

are and so I think you know creating

these new systems on the blockchain

networks where the network designer

creates the core and then the ecosystem

builds all these things around it is a

very exciting thing and by the way you

know I talk about this with some of my

tech friends who aren't in crypto and

they're like oh it sounds weird I'm like

it's literally if you go back in history

of tech like it's there's a long history

of composability okay so specifically

the web and open source software which

are two of the most important the

internet and open source software they

were all built in this way there was a

famous essay in the night I remember in

the 90s I've been into all this

community like I was into Linux in the

90s and I had Linux machine it was very

Niche then

um and I remember uh it was it was it

was very it's hard to remember it's very

radical idea in the 90s to have

um so open source came from really the

80s Richard stallman MIT it was a

radical political movement it was not a

tech movement right it was the idea that

if you read Richard stallman it was that

no one should own software he was

basically against property rights period

and like digital property rights it was

you know he's you know had this whole

kind of group of people and they had the

movement they created gnu and all the

kind of a lot of really important

software

um

and Linux was you know Linus is kind of

fork of that that ran on the on the x86

architecture

um but this idea that like you'd have a

community of people create an operating

system and then people would use it like

it you know it was hobbyists would use

it but no serious people would use it

right

um there's a very famous essay in the

90s called the cathedral and the bazaar

by uh the software developer named Eric

Raymond and he basically said look

there's two there's sort of the

cathedral it's like the priesthood and

this is Microsoft you know it was the

Google of that era right the big

dominant cup or apple or whatever

um and that the cathedral Elite had sort

of you know it was just centralized

priesthood

um the product managers would decide on

the changes the operating system and it

would all kind of flow downward

and the bazaar was this babbling bizarre

of like chaos of people building open

source software

um and

um you know I and so you know that was

and by the way fast forward today I

don't know what the exact stat is but

certainly uh the vast majority of

operating systems in the world are Linux

your Android phone is Linux you know I'd

say like something like half the

software on your Apple phone is open

source all the data centers all the iot

devices are all Linux

um so it like won completely and it just

turned out that having a group of people

packing away on the internet which is a

much better way to build software than

having it done within the cathedral like

the bazaar is a better way the web is

another example Wikipedia is another

example I have a blog post about this it

was funny like people I the revisionism

drives me crazy because I was there

that's why I wrote a blog post I went

and cited all these people it was so

controversial Wikipedia it was like it's

gonna destroy children's Minds kids and

it was literally banned from a lot of

schools it was this crazy thing and it

was like how could you allow you know

I'll if you want if you Google it you'll

see I've wrote A Blog I quoted all of

them because of the revisionism drives

me crazy

um but it was a very very controversial

thing

again like it turns out just like having

enough people kind of collaborate you

can create amazing things right and so

um I kind of think of it I like to say

composability software as compounding

interest as a finance

um there's you know this old phrase

compounding interest is the eighth

wonder of the world or something it's

this amazing thing when you sort of

layer on whatever it is six percent a

year and you compound it

um and I think it's the same thing in

software so the beautiful thing with

software right is you build you write a

piece of code you put it on GitHub and

you write a math function you know

whatever some python math function and

that's it it's you know if it's assuming

it's good code like it's done no one

ever has to write that code again right

and so you have this incredible thing

where this Global Knowledge repository

is sort of building up and you're just

getting kind of more and more powerful

and blockchains harnesses power like

we've just lost it with corporate

networks for me personally it's probably

the most depressing part of the

corporate Network architecture it's just

like all of the innovation has been

siphoned into these priesthoods product

managers PowerPoints whatever they do

and I just think all of the kind of

heart and soul of software has been

sucked dry by them I think that but I

think that there's like it's a pendulum

I it's been it's been happening for 70

years is this pendulum it swings back

and forth and it's going to swing back

and I think once people really start to

see how powerful composability is once

you have a choice hey I could have a

social network where I can choose all

this stuff I can I think it's going to

be a big kind of light bulb moment for a

lot you know you are all on the frontier

but I think there will be like a whole

following wave of technologists who when

they see that and realize the power

reminded of the power of it right it's

not a new idea it's not my idea this is

a very old powerful force in technology

it's just been kind of dormant as we

live in this kind of dark era of

corporate Network dominance

um my view but um

so um funding parity this is just to

make the point like you have you know

nounsdale Lido like these are orders of

magnitude more than RSS ever had

this is money that can be used directly

to fund development so this is when I

went back to saying blockchain networks

have societal benefits of protocol

networks with the competitive advantages

of corporate networks the funding part's

a very important part

um okay I'll stop on the blockchain

stuff I'm going to give a little survey

of like where we are now and then I'm

going to take questions

um

okay so this is I think this is a Lee

and our team did this slide which is

kind of just a you know so so what are

you going to actually build like talk

about all this stuff um

the uh you know the very high level just

always in software the way I think about

it is you have applications and

infrastructure right so infrastructure

can be blockchains it could be wallets

it could be et cetera basically the

simple distinction is infrastructure

your customers or developers

applications your customers or end users

we kind of we divide our team between

that this is how it plays out and every

Computing cycle in Mobile it played out

this way on the web it played out this

way and PCs it played out this way you

know you had Apple

creating the first Steve Jobs and

Wozniak creating the first PC you had

other people building the spreadsheet

and the word processor you know one of

the funny things I've observed in the

history of this is that often the people

even people as genius as Steve Jobs who

of course is like the greatest innovator

you know maybe of the century or

whatever you know incredible but even

they can't they don't predict all the

things people will do with their devices

um he was he was Steve Jobs against

having the App Store you know he had to

get like convinced of it um and before

that you know the spreadsheet and the

word processor and desktop publishing

this all came from third parties random

people

um and so you know so it's very

important to have this kind of interplay

because then then what happens is the

applications make it more popular right

the spreadsheet made the PC more popular

that means you sold more PCS you sold

more chips you sold more hard drives

that then led to you know the kind of

Moore's Law phenomenon where you had

everything got better and cheaper you

had investment in making it better you

know you think about your phone today

that you hold right it's the phone

itself is significantly better than the

first iPhone in 2008

um battery screen everything but the

applications are also much better right

and it's both and the applications fed

the phone I remember a lot of friends of

mine like they're like I don't know if I

want to know touch screen this and that

like what finally tipped them right is

the networks like you had to be on there

because it was WhatsApp and Instagram

and you just couldn't get that stuff on

the BlackBerry and other kinds of Prior

phones and so there's an interplay right

but then the apps being popular that

were created by Third parties that gave

Apple more money to invest to go make

the phones better and so you need both

so we think of it as sort of you always

need both

um here we have just kind of you know

loose categories for

um you know for different categories of

uh applications and infrastructure you

know ideally there's like we're not at

all sort of doctrinaire about the

dogmatic about it like we hope people

will come up with stuff that doesn't fit

into a category and

um but this is just sort of loosely how

we kind of think about the world

um

and then this comes from our team Eddie

and Darren

um you know one thing we were a couple

years ago we were kind of thinking about

is uh what

it feels so chaotic the crypto Winters

the Summers but is there like an

underlying logic to it and

our theory was

um that there's sort of this thing that

happens where you have prices go up and

just sort of more excitement around the

space like you did in these various kind

of periods and that leads more people to

say hey I want to go read the ethereum

white paper I'm going to go like learn

about it and then they actually kind of

get hooked on the real thing on the

stuff I'm talking about like the

technology and the and that kind of

stuff and some portion of them do right

some portion of speculators but some

portion get really hooked by the the

real thing and get involved and join

maybe some of you I don't know when all

of you joined but like you know and then

and then they they join they start a

company they contribute to open source

code and then you know a couple of years

later typically it takes for the sort of

seeds to fully kind of

Bloom and then you see kind of a new

wave of excitement so that was our

Theory and we said let's go see if

that's true and so we did this data

analysis project

and you know we did it was very

interesting anyway so we went and did

this and we think we think that it's

it's hard to measure all the causality

you know with data like this but we

think there's a pretty clear kind of

causal link and what you see is a sort

of steady growth now it is chaotic

um you know it's not steady growth like

you're used to if you're making

accounting software where like every

quarter you're growing consistently or

something like this so crypto is a very

kind of chaotic thing it reminds me a

little bit of AI I had an AI company I

started in 2008 I sold to eBay in 2011.

AI went through if you go read about it

there's they actually use the word AI

winter in AI summer it's like a whole

history of it it was a long long history

I mean it looks like it's finally

eternal Summer now I think that AI

um like it's it's not going to be

another winter but but for 70 Alan

turing's paper 1950 73 years there were

Summers there were winter so the bigger

technologies have more I think more

chaotic

kind of Cycles like this because because

it's some sentiment and funding and just

there's all these other kind of factors

um that play into it as opposed to kind

of the more incremental software it's

just you know if you're familiar with

the s-curve it's like the technology

adoption curve it's kind of where are

you playing on the s-curve are you the

top of the s-curve you know like the

internet like SAS software is more it's

very Innovative about to say anything

negative but it's at the top of the S

curve it's more about adding new

features taking this and applying it to

New Vertical you know we're all at the

bottom of the s-curve

you know lastly I'm a big fan of History

I've I think I've read every book that's

out there on Computing history

technology history I try to

um and I just love the story I was once

an entrepreneur and I just love those

stories of like people in the room and

it's just an incredible thing to see

like

you know like just

three people sitting around having a

beer and talking about an idea and then

and I've seen this now like and I was an

early investor in a lot of the things

that became really big

um and it's just such an amazingly kind

of high impact thing you can do in the

world to like create software

um and be part of these early movements

um and it always you know

it's interesting because it it's very

easy when you read the history to think

well it must have been obvious to do

like a PC in the 80s and things like

this

um it it sort of History Rhymes and

doesn't repeat like there's always a

different set like crypto has its all of

his critics and negative things and

everything else but

um

PCS had their own you know at the time

it was like why like the idea that like

Bill Gates is a big revolutionary idea

was there'll be a piece a computer in

every home that was literally The Motto

and it was like whoa you know

um you know everyone will own part of a

network whoa like these kinds of things

like there's always so anyway so you

kind of think back and like you know

from my favorite stories

uh you know I actually I wrote a few

like I think actually the whole history

of computing in the 1930s is super

interesting with like logicians and

everything else

um the the story of Fairchild

semiconductor Robert Noyes and folks

like that who then really created

Silicon Valley and Intel

um I encourage you to read about that

you know that obviously jobs in mosiak

and what I love what they love about the

PC story is it was a Homebrew Computer

Club which was literally like a hippie

kind of thing like it wasn't you know

like it was literally like this kind of

it was you know kind of like a hackathon

type thing

um where they were just like let's go

and build PCS for the home why would you

want them they didn't have applications

they didn't know why you didn't use them

but that would be cool the original

Apple was today's dollar is five

thousand dollars and you could do like

very little on it you know so like it

was not obvious that that was going to

be like the big thing anyway so

I think about that a lot and I think

about

you know what's exciting to me why I'm

here uh why I think you should be

excited is it's you know I think these

are very special kind of moments when

you have new Computing movements come

they're very high leverage moments I

think this is the most important

Computing movement I think there's other

important ones aivr et cetera and

there'll be a lot of different things

but but to me this because of the things

I discussed earlier because this one

really affects the kind of the future of

the internet like we have to decide do

we want an internet that's like

Disneyland or something like five five

companies own it uh or they want an

internet that's open and decentralized

and Innovative

um I don't see any other plot maybe you

could regulate it I don't see a good

regulatory scheme for doing that to

keeping it open maybe maybe protocol

networks will make a comeback it's been

30 years I don't you know like we'll see

to me this is by far the most credible

kind of way to you know return the

internet to its roots and uh and and

like I think it's the reason you're here

I also think it's a great

entrepreneurial opportunity and you can

really build big important stuff so

that's it

[Music]

I think we have time for questions yeah

I Chris uh thank you for the chat or uh

it seems like there's a fundamental um

conflict between startups trying to get

traction uh and having having it

decentralized uh could you tell us a

little bit more about like um how to

negotiate that pathway of having that

centralized driving force to build

awareness and get users versus having a

decentralized platform

I think it's so I would I would just say

it's a very different go the way I would

describe it is a very different go to

market motion so

on the one hand so like it's basically

on the one it's the top down versus

bottom up okay and I think I think it's

harder if you look at it through the

lens of the top down so what people are

used to for the last 15 years with

startups is you go raise money and you

hire an army okay with what we're doing

in crypto

um it's a different motion which is

You're Gonna Go build the town hall but

then you're gonna ideally inspire a

community right so it's a very different

way to think about that

um you know I I think about look I mean

but they're very powerful tools there's

tokens there's ownership there's

composability

um so I think it was a very different

kind of go to market motion so I'm sorry

that's a that's the business lingo we

use for like how to there's two things

you do at a startup you build a product

and you make it popular

making it popular is go to market okay

um go to market motion is the method by

which you make it popular right

um and so

um

uh you know I look there's there is

actually a long try and this is one of

the things we try to do when we work

with companies is like we we've worked a

lot of companies that have done a what I

would call a Bottoms Up developer go to

market

[Music]

um

and it's a different set of things you

do you focus on obviously great product

great code this is a very Discerning you

know smart audience uh you know

hackathons evangelizing uh documentation

you know funding grants

um

token incentives potentially like just a

bunch of different things like this so

it's a different set of tools but I

think just as important I think like the

two things again the two things you do

at a startup are those two things and

startups should really invest in both

the number one mistake we see in crypto

is sort of this build that they will

come mentality

um that you know you can just go and it

happens occasionally I think it probably

kind of happened with Bitcoin maybe to

some extent with ethereum it generally

doesn't happen

um and and so you need to go and

evangelize and explain and people just

misunderstand what you're doing and all

these other kinds of things

so I think it's sort of I think it was

like strengths there's like it's

different I guess I would say not

necessarily weaker

thank you and one other thing I would

say is like

look it sort of pick your poison like in

so you know our firm does non-crypto and

I still kind of I pay so I'm mostly

crypto but I do pay attention to the

rest of the tech world and you know if

you look at a lot of companies that went

public for example that were started in

the last 15 years non-crypto regular

kind of companies

um the Big Challenge a lot of them is

customer acquisition costs so you know

e-commerce company is an example DTC

Brands like they spend all their money

on Facebook it's a take rates I was

talking about before right that those

companies are very good at extracting

all the money out of the network

um so so you know so they so they have

advanced that's their big kind of

Achilles seal and

whereas like look Bitcoin ethereum like

I think most crypto ads are banned on

Facebook and everything they're all Word

of Mouth everything in crypto is word of

mouth and it's you know think about all

the blog posts and think pieces and and

like you have things like Dogecoin I

think Dogecoin is very interesting

because for like a long time Dogecoin I

was like this is you know it's obviously

a dumb it's a silly cryptocurrency meme

coin it's silly and it annoyed me

because it's like you know and then at

one point I was like you know maybe I

should flip it around instead of

annoying me take a lesson and now I kind

of think a Dogecoin is like this kind of

clinical science experiment where if you

took the dumbest possible

application you know coined is it like

it's not not the technical design but

just like there's no point of it there's

no use cases

um but

it's a clinical experiment because

you're saying you basically have all

these people on the internet in my view

who feel left out of ownership of

networks and

you so the thing that Dogecoin does do

for them is it gives them a feeling of

ownership if you go read I spend time

reading that's when I set a switch I'm

like I'm gonna go like learn about this

community and go read their stuff and it

was a sense of like if you go read like

The 2 million Reddit uh subscribers in

the Dogecoin subreddit

um it's like there's people that like

this is finally an internet service that

I own a piece of right that was a very

powerful thing

um now I'm not bullish on Dogecoin and

meme coins generally

um but what if you take that Evangelical

inspirational power and combine it with

a great product

that's a very powerful force but it's a

very different way to go to market than

like what you people you know they have

if you go hire a marketing person who

ran a web 2 company they'll have a

different Playbook right

hey Chris thank you thank you trying to

get a better understanding of the

regulatory environment and how to

contextualize that could you maybe touch

a little bit on some of the similarities

and differences across web one web two

and web 3 with the regulatory

environment yeah and then what are the

the key things as entrepreneurs should

we be thinking about yeah it's a great

question I mean

I'd say it's a couple of just macro

points

um first of all the regulation was very

important in the first year of the web

there were some very for there was the

uh I forget what it's called like the

internet Commerce Act of 94 commerce was

illegal until that act

um on the web that made it legal that

was very important that was very

forward-thinking

um there was generally a view of what we

describe as regulate the applications

not the protocols and so the idea was

you don't regulate SMTP and HTTP you

regulate the applications

that you know if your Gmail you have to

follow if you have a website you know

you have to follow the law right and

that was very smart because the

protocols are meant to be global and

they're meant to create a global

interoperation Center if you start

regulating the protocols it's going to

kill the protocol because every

jurisdiction has different rules right

so you need these sort of it was a very

smart approach because you had this

um the protocols could do what they're

good at which is sort of the they're the

roads that connect everybody in a common

standard and then if you run a website

you got to follow whatever EU us

whatever pick your you know jurisdiction

um and that was very forward thinking

there was a huge debate in the 90s over

cryptography if you go Google like

Clipper chip and all these you'll see

there was this huge battle and it was a

very uh credible story of um uh sorry a

very formidable side wanted to ban

cryptography they actually I was talking

about a dinner with some of my

colleagues last night they were we used

to have T-shirts that actually that were

illegal T-shirts because they printed

some of the cryptographic code

um and it was like ban the shirt or

whatever you know because

um because I mean they were trying to

ban math and eventually they figured out

like You Can't Ban math like once the

formula is out there like you're

literally trying to ban ideas but that

was a serious debate in fact Ben uh

Horowitz and Mark Andreessen my partners

they so people forget this but that's

their company Netscape

um actually invented SSL invented

JavaScript like cookies this all came

from Netscape

um and uh SSL in particular was

extremely controversial because think

about it like I think I forgot what I

think it was like 94 or something

um at the time there's no internet

Commerce right and so like what are you

gonna do they were literally like

getting hauled in front of Congress

um or some government bodies or so I

forget exactly what but um uh and they

ask you okay so well why do you have

encryption in your browser

and they say well someday people are

going to buy things on the internet okay

what are they doing with it today it's

probably just criminals and terrorists

right and you know what maybe the

critics in 1994 maybe that like they're

they're just there weren't that many

positive use cases right you had to

believe in this future

and like thankfully that didn't get bad

but it came very close to it um and in

fact Netscape uh the 128-bit version of

Netscape I think until late 90s was uh

classified as Munitions by the US

government same classification as cruise

missiles

um you could not you could not download

it outside the US I remember when I was

young downloading soft you're always

getting these things like are you in the

US you can't download this it's like so

you know I think thankfully dmca there's

a bunch of very I think good regulation

in the end

um

my colleague Colin likes to say the U.S

does it tries every form of bad

regulation before they figure it out you

know like and so like there were all

these sort of different things but I

think it actually was done very very

well and look that led to the internet a

lot of internet activity being in the

U.S this is it was a great it was very

forward-thinking I think a lot of people

sometimes people in Industry

uh I think don't give regular smart

Regulators enough credit because I think

the good ones see this and find a good

Balancing Act and look and you you want

regulation like we we spend most of our

times believe it or not

is not always popular in the crypto

Community but like we we've been also

trying to get more guidance and

regulation because what happens when you

don't have it is you have an ins you

have a an incentive to act badly right

this is why you have these ftxs and

things the incentive is to go offshore

to offer 100x derivatives to do all

these things because you get because

they spend all their time going after

the good actors like the us-based

companies that are following the rules

and they ignore those actors and so you

you create these very perverse

incentives right

um so like it's a very active space like

we have spent a lot of time on it we're

trying to make the case that there's the

you know that

um that there's a balance between

Innovation and you know we obviously

want all these it's bad for everybody

it's bad for the world it's bad for the

industry to have the ftxs and you know

consumers hurt and all these other

things we think that we've published

very detailed

proposals here we think there are ways

to do that and to sort of navigate

across like it's very hard like there's

not only is it the US there's other

countries within the US there's probably

five major regulatory agencies that are

involved so it's the actual specifics

would be like talk to Legal teams

um I'm not going to give legal advice

but that's kind of the The Meta policy

View

thank you yeah well thank you um the

second question is you mentioned about

how gaming

um creates a virtual economy and I

recently have also learned a podcast

related to like how copyright approaches

the freemium games and also like right

now mobile games like half of the market

uh share for the whole like gaming

economy I'm curious on your cell sound

the point of view of what's currently

what's a website gaming are at and how

it will impact the whole like web3

economy so where is Webster gaming at

and how will impact the economy yeah

good question so

I think there's okay this is I could

this is a big topic I think so I think

they're sort of

so I like to use this so I guess for

every one of these Technologies there's

kind of a light version and a heavy duty

version and so the light version of web3

gaming which we've already seen some of

and we're going to see more we funded

probably 15 web3 game companies most of

which haven't launched their products

yet so like you're going to see like in

the next 12 months some really high

quality these are teams at a very top

game companies launch web 3 games so to

your question look games just take a

long time they can take I mean Grand

Theft Auto how long has it been it's

like the most anticipated game like what

12 years or something I mean they just

it's really not not that everything is

that elaborate but games take a long

time so it's going to take some time but

there's to me there's sort of the

lightweight versions of web3 game which

is like a game that's like a normal game

but you have nfts you have virtual Goods

you can take take from one game to

another create secondary markets you

know kind of like build an economy

around a more robust economy around the

goods but then to me the really more

sort of ambitious idea is

kind of like the fully on chain games

where everything is the whole back end

is a shared composable service

and like and then this gets into the

topic of like metaverse you know which

is kind of a buzzword but I think I

think a real thing which is we're gonna

just sort of you look at the extrapolate

from the trends and like gaming is going

to continue to be more and more

important people's lives virtual reality

is going to eventually happen people are

going to spend more time on the internet

more jobs on the internet more virtual

worlds like all this sort of Trends

we've seen over the last 10 years

they'll continue and that's sort of the

metaverse is like people just spending a

ton of time meeting their spouses doing

their jobs like it's this virtual world

and to me there's a very important

question which is is this metaverse you

know kind of uh Ready Player one style

owned by what was the company uh

but I don't know whatever evil Corp

um if is it owned by evil Corp or is it

uh you know is it a sort of shared

decentralized network right like to me

that's a very important question which

actually this is probably the right time

if you just look at history like the

right time to really think about RSS and

fix it would have been like 2006 or

something because then you had the

iPhone that was what happens is you have

these catalysts right and the Catalyst

kind of entrench

like you'll have the the horses are kind

of racing RSS and Facebook and Facebook

was a little bit ahead and then the

iPhone came out and boom it just sort of

like and this is all backed up if you

look at the stats like so you have these

catalysts so maybe there's a catalyst

next to you that maybe AI maybe VR who

knows some something may happen to

catalyze and make this whole metaverse

thing that sounds kind of futuristic

actually be a real thing in five years

and I think that like right now it's

time to think about the architecture for

that and I think games are kind of a

wedge into that like you know like the

stuff that Xerox Park stuff for those

are into this stuff like there's a bunch

of you know the um Dark Forest like

there's a bunch of sort of really

interesting ideas there the idea that

you have a shared back-end like what's

cool about like something like a dark

Forest right is the back end is fully on

chain and then somebody else can create

like a different front end they can Fork

it they can add stuff onto it so it sort

of takes what's a very powerful force in

already in gaming like modding and

things

um but it puts it on steroids so I think

it's a very exciting area look also

games just historically have always been

a very good kind of beachhead

uh category for new Computing platforms

early mobile a lot of it was driven it's

a way to just get a lot of people

onboarded used to it using wallets

I think the most likely thing in the

next couple of years that will get us

200 million active crypto users is

probably a game

um I don't I

so is that someone building a game but

but like but that's not like to me

that's part of it right like the point

of the eye like I'm not I like games but

the point of that film is not games

right the point the games help drive it

and we're kind of the wedge

thank you yeah

hi Chris thanks for the talk Brandon um

I completely agree with your uh

characterization of Federated networks

versus kind of truly decentralized

social networks I'm curious about your

thoughts of the fundamental value that

grounds the meaning of ownership in a

decentralized social network because it

sounds like to compete with traditional

corporate networks you need to offer

feature parity and also some sense of

ownership that kind of offsets the

network effects that the corporate

networks already have

but what does that ownership mean

because the corporate networks have done

a pretty good job of creating the

economic value in the existing Networks

well I think specifically with

blockchain social networks so we're

talking about so like so

so you know one way to think so any

network there's generally like most

networks the networks we're talking

about are two-sided networks meaning

there's two set there's users and what I

would call like creators and developers

right the sort of the sellers and the

buyers if you will they're not buyers

but like the people that consume the you

know people that create the videos on

YouTube and people that watch the videos

right

um and whenever you have a two-sided

market like the first go to market

question will be which side do you go

after all right because like it so like

and this is true of UB like uber Uber

decided the drivers were the hard part

you know like there's always a hard side

and an easier side

um I would argue with crypto social

networks you want to go after the sell

side you want to go after you want to go

to the musician who's currently getting

you know whatever pennies for thousands

of streams and this is like essentially

there's a whole economy of creators who

are all about working around the 100

take rates they don't use this word

language because it's been so

successfully obfuscated from them that

they pay this because they just think of

it's just like that's how social

networks work it doesn't have to be that

way it's like an accident history

um but you know so they what do they do

they go and they sell merch they you

know there's a huge industry around that

there's they go and they you know they

have a Shopify thing they try to kind of

get people over to it they do offline

stuff they do pay this with patreon and

substack exists they're essentially

substack is the way to get around

Twitter take rates patreon's a waiting

on YouTube right you get them over to

your patreon you get direct money and

you still pay but it's five percent

because it's on the web and webbed is

real competition and like

and so

um

so I think with social networks like I

think it'll be it's it's nuanced because

you got to get both sides and you can't

like it's not like I'm just saying you

go magically get these musicians and go

to market you gotta cultivate both sides

but I think the really really strong

value proposition is the economic side

to the creators who just like it's

dramatically better economics and that's

that will play out at some point because

if you're just if you're offered a

system where you can have the same thing

and get 100 or get or not 100 but 90 95

whatever it is or you know zero percent

like is to me no question right I agree

thank you yeah thanks how do you think

about defensibility in web 3 for

protocols like you know when uniswap

gets forked or something like that

yeah I mean

I mean to me this all kind of boils down

to all sorts of the take rates right

like like

uniswap I think has remained

you know I think most people would agree

has remain quite successful despite the

forks and things like this

um if they charge 90 take rate they

would not have been successful like they

you know so like you know so part of it

is like the defensibilities are simply

much lower

and that that plays in that's why the

take rates are lower that's why a lot of

the benefits flow to Consumers and not

to the companies

um so that's just a fact of this space

and I think one of the reasons is better

for the world

um

but it you know defensibility in the end

comes down to pricing power and pricing

power and networks is take rates

um so I think as a result you'll expect

much lower take rates

um but but I think I think the way I

view it is you know there's an old kind

of venture capital meme zero uh was a

zero billion dollar market or something

like there was this old

for a long time people who who are

internet investors would talk about this

like the goal is to kind of build things

like think of Craigslist where

Craigslist is actually it's it's just

owned by I think you know Craig and his

friends or whatever

um but it's it's this wildly profitable

100 million dollar plus profit a year

business right

what they did is they took this giant

market the classified Market which was

previously a much larger by Revenue

industry than it is today and they

basically deflated it it's deflationary

a lot of technology is deflationary

right you shrink the market

um but you know but they were also you

know

um

they just run a website they don't have

to run all the printing machines and

everything else and so I think with a

lot of these decentralized networks

it'll probably be a similar thing which

is like

you also don't fun you know you

you have much lower take rates but you

also don't have to have a sushi chef and

50 000 employees and like all the you

know it's a decentralized network right

like it's just like you know real estate

like so the costs are much lower too so

it'll be kind of that Craigslist effect

I think

does that make sense yeah awesome thank

you so much

after doing this I'm Lucas from Thurgood

and my question is uh which critiques of

web3 and its assumptions do you think

are the most valid

well I think there's like a I mean like

I mean saying it's early like or that it

hasn't gone mainstream yet rather it's

not early but it hasn't like you know

it's not at a billion you know the

internet's five billion users and

you know probably like the stuff that we

like to use is you know 10 like metamask

is like 10 million or something so a

fraction of the size so that's

legitimate I mean to me my response

would be

okay like that's what we do in venture

capital and like a lot of the markets

are early and that's why there's

opportunity to be an entrepreneur like

I'd see that as I flip that around and

see that as an opportunity

um what else uh I think a lot of the

other critiques I find it just are

literally straw man arguments like

they're just talking about like the

the rat poison magic beans like tokens

are all made up like okay it's just it's

virtual economies it's very easy I can

explain it it's not any kind of fancy

economics

I think a lot of people don't even you

know they haven't done the frankly done

the work to go understand the history of

the internet how networks work Network

architecture I think until you've just

had that discussion and understood those

things like it's very hard to critique

blockchain networks if you don't

understand

the history of the internet and the

other network architectures and how

Network architectures influence Network

economics it's I find most of the

conversations are just very hard to have

because they haven't had done that prior

work

but I look I don't know what do you

think are the good critiques I mean uh

going back to saying it's early you said

earlier that we're at the beginning of

the edge curve so how do we figure out

where we're like What would be the web

to analog of like where we are

yeah I was

Eddie and I here we're talking about

this at dinner last night Eddie Lazarus

back there uh you know who I'm sure

you'll meet but um

like I think I think kind of what you're

saying is like what's the inflection

point yeah and like Eddie Eddie's view

is just all going to come down to and he

may be right like block space

um cost like when you have l2s 4844 all

this other stuff where you have you know

sub Penny anyone Kevin Kelly has this

great blog post he's a founder of wired

and kind of this blogger uh thinker

um so you don't have Innovation until

you have waste so like until you can

take a thousand photos and throw them

away you don't have Instagram until you

have do a thousand searches and throw

them away and like we don't have waste

yet like you need to have like a thou

like web3 gaming the earlier question it

shouldn't be just 15 companies funded by

a16z it should be 10 lines of code a kid

in wherever India Indiana you name it

create some cool thing it's so easy it's

so cheap it's it's not like that today

you've got to be like a pretty deep

smart contract engineer you got to learn

all this stuff you got to pay money like

you know I it's funny like I I one

argument is just it's just all about

like AI you know AI you go back and read

stuff I I used to talk them right about

Ai and like you have this long history

of people debating when will aihap and

everything else if you look at it now if

you believe like this is it and it's

really hitting it really just came down

to gpus and neural networks and like how

much scale you had on those things like

all the other kind of complicated

analysis was probably unnecessary and

had you just sort of gone and said you

know look look at Moore's Law look at

nvidia's GPU density how many nodes in a

neural network at what point will it

start to approximate a human brain like

that's and people did that like you know

Ray Kurzweil and others but like that's

kind of the thing that mattered and I

think it's probably the similar here

like look I mean there's other things we

need I think the infrastructure I think

some people a bit here are building

wallets and other kinds of the tooling

is not there yet quite

um there were all these there's a whole

section in the 90s at Barnes and Noble

of how to get on the internet

literally you would go because you had

to go and download this there's all

these crazy ppoe I remember there's like

these crazy protocols and windows and

like download how do you download so

like the big innovation literally go

read the history go read the good books

on AOL was send everyone a CD because it

was this chicken egg how are you going

to download the protocol if you're on

the internet right so they sent them all

CDs that was a big breakthrough

it sounds ridiculous but that's that's

that was that was 1998 you know so I

mean

um a couple years into it

yeah answer your question I think some

people say that there is this waste in

terms of like the noise in terms of

hacks in terms of like the centralized

yeah I meant waste in the sense of

experimentation right as opposed to yes

that's that's a different sense of waste

yeah thank you yeah thank you

hi Chris uh thanks for the talk I'm Nico

I'm from Skylab so we are building

mechanisms that allow developers and

Gamers to interact with so we have been

thinking a lot about incentive design so

what do you think of um like compared to

say the corporate Network right

um there's a center party that can make

decisions of like how to incentivize the

uh Community Based on uh their first of

all their their incentives and also

considering other people's incentives

right but for for web 3

incentives are more decentralized so and

that opens to a lot of exploits um so

how do you how what do you think of like

what to balance how to balance that and

uh

yeah so you're saying like particularly

with like exploits like yeah so for

example like when you uh for example

like noun style they have to consider uh

how to prevent people from exploiting

the treadery so things like that um I

see it's like kind of like a selfish

bribery attack and like yeah yeah

because everything is yeah well great

question so like let's talk about I

didn't talk about governance yet so the

way I think about governance so

um

prior to blockchains like what is what

is the governance of protocol networks

the governance of protocol networks

basically is

um we're going to create a spec and you

could deviate another way to think about

governance is what happens if a bunch of

nodes go evil

okay so like what happens if a bunch of

SMTP you have email protocol what if

some of the nodes decide you know what

I'm going to start charging everybody to

send an email okay with protocol

networks you basically you basically

protect against that because you have so

many different nodes that if you do that

everyone's gonna be like well I'm not

going to use you you're crap right

because you've got such decentralization

that you've basically have checked the

power of Bad actors right corporate

networks we kind of said screw it let's

just have a dictatorship and hope they

don't turn evil don't be evil

you can judge yourself whether that

worked but there's no governance it's

just like it's literally corporate

governance it's the CEOs the board

um to me the big innovation with

blockchain networks is now you can you

can now write it's not it's not that

we've solved governance I don't think

that's solved yet and maybe it'll never

be it's like humans don't solve

governance I don't know if they ever do

maybe they just come to like an

equilibrium point that doesn't it's not

awful or something right like but um the

the big thing about blockchain networks

is we can now we can now encode

governance into software

right and software is you know as

expressive as human thought it's the

software is the you know computational

embodiment of human thought and so

anything it's sort of like we've now

invented a constitution you can now

write down the rules for the first time

instead of relying on the network

topology in the case of protocol

networks or the Goodwill of a management

team in the case of corporate networks

so we can now write it down okay and

that's a very to me that that's the big

innovation of blockchain governance is

we can now create kind of a formal

Constitution

I I just I'm going to say it this way so

I want to careful like we're not to not

oversell it like we haven't solved

governance but we can now at least start

to have like a really mature interesting

debate around it and in Ideal World if

like we've got a few people but like

governance people to think about

governance would get more interested in

this area and

start working on it like we have Andy

Hall at Stanford who's gotten who's

works with us and there's like a few

other kind of governance experts and I

think more and more getting in there

again I don't think we're going to solve

it but I think we can come up with good

equilibrium states that are kind of that

work well

um but that's the big innovation to me

in blockchain right is that you can now

put into software the governance system

and like what nounselves do I think is

super interesting right like they're

they're a lot of the stuff will have to

come through experimentation right and

they're running some really interesting

experiments

specifically to bribery attacks or like

selfish attacks you know I think the

probably the number one mid against that

is a diverse Community you simply don't

have

single actors with that you know I think

other mechanisms like slashing and other

kinds of punitive mechanisms can be

helpful so I think there's a bunch of

tools there but

you know and how do you balance that

against all the other thing it's these

are complicated questions so

for sure thank you thank you

thank you

um Nikita from chain Patrol I had a

question around uh you know MMOs and you

know the economies that you talked about

um you know right now even just managing

like something like the economy in

RuneScape is difficult like you tweak

one spawn rate or something and like all

the markets change

um do you think uh one do you think any

of these MMOs will open up their economy

to like this global global crypto like

economy because now they have to deal

with like external like external things

maybe outside of their control

hey yeah

yeah well if you're asking me

specifically like will existing games

kind of add this I think some some will

um but it won't be generally the way

these Tech movements work is there's a

new cohort like if you look at gaming uh

free to play gaming and mobile

um what happened was that free to play

started around 2010-ish when IAP started

in an app store and you know the usual

kind of thing where the incumbents sort

of like nfcs they kind of dismissed it

and then there was a new set of startups

including supercells most probably the

most prominent success

um and that those new startups all

became more 10 billion and sort of you

know it's a circle of life and startups

right big companies say this is you know

they there's usually some mixed some of

them dismiss it some do it but do it

half-heartedly a few of them may be

going all in

that's typically what happened and then

and then but most of the opportunity is

taken by startups that's kind of the

historical pattern and that'd be my

default assumption here some will do it

a few few Cutting Edge ones will do it

some won't like the pro these companies

existing big companies like

unless you're founder-led it's just very

hard for them to do kind of new things

there's a whole bunch it's as long as

for those who worked a big it's very

complicated even if the CEO is visionary

and wants to do it like they have a

board they have people on the team you

know I think the I think like I think in

a lot of ways it's a blessing for us

that this nft controversy it's the

craziest thing in the world to me and if

that letting people own if something is

controversial like it's better to have

the company own it like it's upside down

the world but the fact that it is is

probably an opportunity because you have

these revolts and other things and it's

like okay if you wanna

big company wants to not do this you

know we'll just see startups do it so

I'd say I don't know we'll see it'll be

interesting to see

and how do you think

um you know when you're designing a game

economy is there any like approaches

you've seen or things you'd recommend

when

um you know to balance your economy when

it's like connected to this wider system

it's on a closed economy

yeah I mean like this is you know

you know the

Federal Reserve is a you know giant

organization of people that tune one

parameter right so like it's unsolved

problems these are very hard problems no

one solved these things and I expect I

think one would be you got to keep it

flexible like governance systems

parameter tuning needs to be something

it's going to get you're going to get it

wrong

so it needs to be something you've kind

of fine-tuned

um I mean specifically to protocol

design like Eddie and other folks on our

team like that's what they do and they

have a whole I think he's giving a whole

talk on it so I won't try to try to um

you know so take all the all the

specific kind of stuff I would say

um

you know I kind of what I was saying

before like the key thing to me with

faucets is I guess three things I would

say one is balance like what you don't

want to do I think people have made this

mistake where you get too much demand

you get a speculative run and then you

get a bunch of unhappy users right like

so you want to balance supply and demand

and have like a healthy sustainable

growing economy same thing you want to

do in a regular economy right like you

don't want to have stocks go too high or

too low you want to have just like stuff

grow hopefully it never actually works

that way but like an ideal world

everything would just grow three percent

you know GDP or whatever

um

and then you want faucets that

incentivize constructive behavior that

they're actually helping to build the

network doing building software doing

good stuff you know not like the bad

case is like all the you know like the

some of the farming stuff that happens

and like you don't want just like bot

farming and things so how do you kind of

figure that out and then on the sinks I

think aligning it with like like getting

more true players to play the game

they spend money I think like with

gaming specifically like probably you

know you need games that are

fundamentally fun and then people come

for that and then there's there's sort

of an economic flywheel built on top of

it so you're also I think of that as

kind of

buffering the economic side the fact

that you have the sort of fundamental

economy right I mean why is the

Commodities exchange CBOE in Chicago why

is the New York Stock Exchange in New

York and it's because the Commodities of

derivatives and Futures and all these

other things because because they they

came out of agriculture

so you had soybeans and you need to

hedge it and so you had this pairing of

kind of the fundamental economy and the

kind of the the you know the economic

side of it and so I think of the same

thing in a game is like you want to have

this sort of core thing people are maybe

literally like you know building their

stardew Valley Farm or whatever but then

you layer on like an economy on top of

it right so I think that's another kind

of buffering thing but it's a great

question and it's a deep topic and I

want to try to like cover it all now

thank you

okay

uh JP from friends yeah so I have a

question around

um just like consumer products and how

in web 3 a lot of consumer products are

built on on desktop because

um there's no Gatekeepers you're not

dealing with iOS Android you're talking

earlier about gatekeeping around like

Kindle how you can't buy Kindle uh book

without going to the website

um so recently like uni swap they just

created a wallet right and even they

couldn't navigate this particular like

app store approval process my question

is like if we're going to get products

out to the devices that people actually

use like what how do we navigate this

how do we navigate like mobile

Gatekeepers platforms and what how does

this environment have to evolve in order

for crypto to be able to be like

actually viable products for for mobile

users yeah I mean as you know like the

workarounds include desktop they include

web mobile but it's an issue like

particularly the power of Apple and

Google right I mean this is the first

time we've had a Computing platform

like a device layer Computing platform

that was just a duopoly

um

and they are very aggressive on that you

know and I I don't have I honestly don't

have a great solution there except for

at some point you would expect there to

be regulatory pressure due to the fact

that it's clearly stifling competition

but

that takes a while so I don't I mean I

wish I had a better answer there you

know look I think use case I think

having hit games and other kinds of

popular use cases that clearly are not

speculative that show True fundamental

value will help change the narrative

around some of this stuff and that will

also help so that's kind of on you know

hopefully some folks in here help with

that by creating popular stuff

okay thanks yeah

sweet I got it um hi Chris Brendan from

Kiki you talked a little about earlier

from the adoption perspective you know

block space wallet really from the build

side of the app layer when it comes to

end user adoption so think consumer from

a product perspective let's say what's

what's the most important Behavior to

educate people on and to really feel

comfortable with to engaging with

companies that live within the

blockchain space or are building in that

layer

yeah that's a great question I mean I

think I I guess embedded in that

question like I'm not sure we software

gets an opportunity to edu like

ultimately you know when you're talking

about the marginal billions user like

it's got to be probably a lot simpler

than something that educates them so

like a lot of it has to be just baked

into the software experience and there

has to be so you know like I think

there's a lot of things we can do to

improve but my suspicion is that

um

sort of what I was talking about earlier

like feature parity like we just have to

have feature parity like it has to be as

easy as onboarding it has to be like

totally modern experience I don't think

we're quite there yet

um there's you know things these are all

solvable problems but things like Key

Management you know has to all be kind

of just seamless and behind the scenes I

think a lot of people are doing good

work there and that just takes time and

it'll happen

um and then I think ultimately like look

it'll be I think this a lot of this will

be an economic proposition like it's

just a very low hanging fruit how bad

the economics are in corporate networks

so

I think it'll I can say take social

networks I think it'll be creator-led

creators will say I'm tired of paying

100 percent

and I want a different solution we're

already seeing that with things like sub

stack people moving over there and I

think if we can provide the right

Solutions people will move over to

better social networks and then the user

the end user might just come because

their favorite musicians there right

like it's simple as that right like that

to me is a more plausible path for

example for a social network than like

the end user is not going to care about

decentralization not going to care about

all these kind of high-minded things but

the centralization plays into these

things they do care a lot about

especially the supply side of like do

you want to pay 100 of your money to

this company like it's just a that's

that's the thing that's really

reassuring especially on the social

networking side it's just really really

bad right now the economics for most

network network participants and so you

know if we were competing against this

like you know lean mean you know thing

that like they had five percent take

rates and like honestly like I think

it's harder on payments that's that the

payment take rates are two percent like

should two percent of the economy go to

payments moving some bits around

probably not but it's harder to go after

a two percent Target than a 90 100 a lot

harder because okay it's one percent and

they subsidize and they give you points

and all these other things and like

you know so that I think that could be

one of the sort of mistakes people have

made in history of cryptos that are

going after

some industries that actually you know

are fair much more resilient because the

lower take rates

thank you I feel like once you see the

world through the network economics lens

I don't know well that's how I just view

everything now it's like what are the

economics of this and like because in

the end like that I sort of believe a

lot of the economics drives these

behaviors so

great thank you all

oh
